# GenericLVExtensionAlgorithm

## Introduction and project purpose

The project GenericLVExtensionAlgorithm contains an extension algorithm for low voltage networks. 
The algorithm is going to be published at the journal of physics proceeding series and was introduced at the **[SciGRID conference 2017](https://www.scigrid.de/pages/scigrid-conference-2017.html)]**. 
We licensed the work under the MIT-License. Please contact us, if this is not suitable for you. 

## Documentation

Please read and cite the [related conference paper](https://www.scigrid.de/pages/scigrid-conference-2017.html). The paper contains test for a radial, a loop, and a heavily meshed network. We show that the algorithm is capable of calculating the extension for generic low-voltage networks of any given topology based on voltage range deviations and thermal overloads. Only information about line and cable lengths, their topology and the network state is required. At the paper, we show that the algorithm functions for electrical networks with these topologies. Here we going to add additional examples for more comprehensive networks.
